# Intent-to-service inference map
#
# Maps natural language phrases to broker service names.
# Used by the auto-infer feature (disabled by default in config.yaml).
# Matching is case-insensitive substring.
#
# To extend: add new phrase -> service entries below.
# Service names must match entries in the broker's service registry
# (check GET / on the broker for available services).
